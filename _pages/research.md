This paper calculates the degree of intragenerational income mobility and carries out the decomposition of the influence of observable characteristics on income mobility. Using the concept of mobility as the equalization of longer-term incomes, we quantify the class of measures called the E index using administrative records for social security contributions of formally employed young adults in Colombia between 2010 and 2018. In addition, we use the Recentered Influence Function (RIF) decomposition method to extend its application to the E index and decompose the influence of observable characteristics on our estimates. Our findings indicate Colombia's mobility is disequalizing. We also show that female mobility is even more disequalizing than male mobility. Our decomposition shows that disequalizing mobility depends on employees' type of contract, economic sector, and location.

**Labor Market Flows of Young Workers in Colombia** 2023.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('log0')">Abstract</a> | [Slides][labor-slides] | [Draft][labor-draft] ] </small>

<div id="log0" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
Identifying the effect of policies focused on transitions towards formality of young adult workers is important to understand the effectiveness of labor policy instruments. This research article examines how payroll tax cuts affect labor market flows of young workers in Colombia through the analysis of the First Job Act (Law 1429 of 2010), which encouraged hiring of workers under 28 years of age. I present a conceptual framework, based on the on-the-job search model of Narita (2020), to explain channels through which a payroll tax cuts affect labor transitions in developing economies. Then, I use data from the Colombian National Labor Survey (Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares) to assess the effect of a reduction in payroll taxes, taking advantage of the age specific eligibility cutoff (28 years of age or younger). The main result shows a positive effect of 2,8 percentage points in fostering transitions into formal employment of workers between 20 and 28 years. The effect is larger for men in the same age group and individuals with less school attainment. Finally, I present evidence of positive effects in flows between other employment states as unemployment to self-employment and out of labor force to formal employment. These results suggest that payroll tax reductions have a positive effect on the flow of young workers into formal employment.
